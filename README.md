# Human-Resource-Information-System
A Windows desktop application which is developed using C#.

The objective of the system is to provide easy access for front desk staff to critical (but public) information about each staff member so  they can answer student queries easily. This information includes phone, room location and the units they  teach.  The  information,  which  includes  both  textual  data  and  staff  photos,  is  to  be  presented via a Windows 8 or 10 desktop application.

The Human Resource Information System will consist of two main components: staff lists and unit timetable display. These may be enhanced by the addition of another component: activity heat map.

The user is able to view an interactive list of staff employed by the School. The Staff List view is able to filter the displayed staff based on their category. The user is able to list all staff, academic, technical, administrative, and casual.
